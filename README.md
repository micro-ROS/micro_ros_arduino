# micro-ROS for Arduino

This is a **experimental** micro-ROS library for baremetal projects based on Arduino IDE or Arduino CLI.
As the build process for ROS 2 and micro-ROS is based on custom meta-build system tools and CMake, this library is provided as a precompiled library. Anyways, users can rebuild its own precompiled libraries in order to modify micro-ROS parameters, for example customizing prebuild meta file.

Supported boards are:

You can find the available precompiled ROS 2 types for messages and services in [available_ros2_types](available_ros2_types).

## How to use the precompiled library

Go to [link to release section](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino/releases) and download the last release of micro-ROS library for Arduino. 

Include it in your proyect using `Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP Library...`

You can test micro-ROS examples located in this repo examples folder.

Is possible to use a micro-ROS Agent just with this docker command:

```bash
# Serial micro-ROS Agent
docker run -it --rm -v /dev:/dev --privileged --net=host microros/micro-ros-agent:foxy serial --dev [YOUR BOARD PORT] -v6
```

## How to build the precompiled library

<!-- 
pushd extras/library_generation
docker build . -t micro_ros_arduino_builder:foxy
popd
 -->

```bash
docker pull microros/micro_ros_arduino_builder:foxy
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/arduino_project microros/micro_ros_arduino_builder:foxy
```
Note that folders added to `extras/library_generation/extra_packages` and entries added to `extras/library_generation/extra_packages/extra_packages.repos` will be taken into account by this build system.

## Patch Arduino board for support precompiled libraries
### Patch Teensyduino

Go inside your Arduino + Teensyduino installation and replace `platform.txt`:

```bash
export ARDUINO_PATH=[Your Arduino + Teensiduino path]
cd $ARDUINO_PATH/hardware/teensy/avr/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino/foxy/extras/patching_boards/platform_teensy.txt > platform.txt
```

### Patch SAMD

Go inside your Arduino + Teensyduino installation and replace `platform.txt`:

```bash
export ARDUINO_PATH=[Your Arduino path]
cd $ARDUINO_PATH/hardware/sam/1.6.12/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino/foxy/extras/patching_boards/platform_arduinocore_sam.txt > platform.txt
```

## Known Issues/Limitations

- When using provided precompiled libraries, users should take into account the already configured static memory pools in middleware layers. [More info here](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/microxrcedds_rmw_configuration/).
- micro-ROS transports should be refactored in order to provide a pluggable mechanims. Only USB serial transports are provided.
- Teensyduino support files have to be patched in order to use precompiled libraries.
