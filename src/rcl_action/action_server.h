/**
 * After calling this function on a rcl_action_server_t, it can be used to take
 * goals of the given type for the given action name using rcl_action_take_goal_request()
 * and take cancel requests with rcl_action_take_cancel_request().
 * It can also send a result for a request using rcl_action_send_result() or
 * rcl_action_send_cancel_response().
 *
 * After accepting a goal with rcl_action_take_goal_request(), the action server can
 * be used to send feedback with rcl_action_publish_feedback() and send status
 * messages with rcl_action_publish_status().
 *
 * The given rcl_node_t must be valid and the resulting rcl_action_server_t is
 * only valid as long as the given rcl_node_t remains valid.
 *
 * The give rcl_clock_t must be valid and the resulting rcl_ction_server_t is
 * only valid as long ast he given rcl_clock_t remains valid.
 *
 * The rosidl_action_type_support_t is obtained on a per .action type basis.
 * When the user defines a ROS action, code is generated which provides the
 * required rosidl_action_type_support_t object.
 * This object can be obtained using a language appropriate mechanism.
 * \todo TODO(jacobperron) write these instructions once and link to it instead
 *
 * For C, a macro can be used (for example `example_interfaces/Fibonacci`):
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <rosidl_runtime_c/action_type_support_struct.h>
 * #include <example_interfaces/action/fibonacci.h>
 * const rosidl_action_type_support_t * ts =
 *   ROSIDL_GET_ACTION_TYPE_SUPPORT(example_interfaces, Fibonacci);
 * ```
 *
 * For C++, a template function is used:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include <rosidl_runtime_cpp/action_type_support.hpp>
 * #include <example_interfaces/action/fibonacci.h>
 * using rosidl_typesupport_cpp::get_action_type_support_handle;
 * const rosidl_action_type_support_t * ts =
 *   get_action_type_support_handle<example_interfaces::action::Fibonacci>();
 * ```
 *
 * The rosidl_action_type_support_t object contains action type specific
 * information used to send or take goals, results, and feedback.
 *
 * The topic name must be a c string that follows the topic and service name
 * format rules for unexpanded names, also known as non-fully qualified names:
 *
 * \see rcl_expand_topic_name
 *
 * The options struct allows the user to set the quality of service settings as
 * well as a custom allocator that is used when initializing/finalizing the
 * client to allocate space for incidentals, e.g. the action server name string.
 *
 * Expected usage (for C action servers):
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <rcl/rcl.h>
 * #include <rcl_action/rcl_action.h>
 * #include <rosidl_runtime_c/action_type_support_struct.h>
 * #include <example_interfaces/action/fibonacci.h>

 * // ... error handling
 * const rosidl_action_type_support_t * ts =
 *   ROSIDL_GET_ACTION_TYPE_SUPPORT(example_interfaces, Fibonacci);
