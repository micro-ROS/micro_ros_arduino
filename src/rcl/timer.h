/// Initialize a timer.
/**
 * A timer consists of a clock, a callback function and a period.
 * A timer can be added to a wait set and waited on, such that the wait set
 * will wake up when a timer is ready to be executed.
 *
 * A timer simply holds state and does not automatically call callbacks.
 * It does not create any threads, register interrupts, or consume signals.
 * For blocking behavior it can be used in conjunction with a wait set and
 * rcl_wait().
 * When rcl_timer_is_ready() returns true, the timer must still be called
 * explicitly using rcl_timer_call().
 *
 * The timer handle must be a pointer to an allocated and zero initialized
 * rcl_timer_t struct.
 * Calling this function on an already initialized timer will fail.
 * Calling this function on a timer struct which has been allocated but not
 * zero initialized is undefined behavior.
 *
 * The clock handle must be a pointer to an initialized rcl_clock_t struct.
 * The life time of the clock must exceed the life time of the timer.
 *
 * The period is a non-negative duration (rather an absolute time in the
 * future).
 * If the period is `0` then it will always be ready.
 *
 * The callback is an optional argument.
 * Valid inputs are either a pointer to the function callback, or `NULL` to
 * indicate that no callback will be stored in rcl.
 * If the callback is `NULL`, the caller client library is responsible for
 * firing the timer callback.
 * Else, it must be a function which returns void and takes two arguments,
 * the first being a pointer to the associated timer, and the second a int64_t
 * which is the time since the previous call, or since the timer was created
 * if it is the first call to the callback.
 *
 * Expected usage:
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <rcl/rcl.h>
 *
 * void my_timer_callback(rcl_timer_t * timer, int64_t last_call_time)
 * {
 *   // Do timer work...
 *   // Optionally reconfigure, cancel, or reset the timer...
 * }
 *
 * rcl_context_t * context;  // initialized previously by rcl_init()...
 * rcl_clock_t clock;
 * rcl_allocator_t allocator = rcl_get_default_allocator();
 * rcl_ret_t ret = rcl_clock_init(RCL_STEADY_TIME, &clock, &allocator);
 * // ... error handling
 *
 * rcl_timer_t timer = rcl_get_zero_initialized_timer();
 * ret = rcl_timer_init(
 *   &timer, &clock, context, RCL_MS_TO_NS(100), my_timer_callback, allocator);
 * // ... error handling, use the timer with a wait set, or poll it manually, then cleanup
 * ret = rcl_timer_fini(&timer);
 * // ... error handling
