/**
 * After calling this function on a rcl_publisher_t, it can be used to publish
 * messages of the given type to the given topic using rcl_publish().
 *
 * The given rcl_node_t must be valid and the resulting rcl_publisher_t is only
 * valid as long as the given rcl_node_t remains valid.
 *
 * The rosidl_message_type_support_t is obtained on a per .msg type basis.
 * When the user defines a ROS message, code is generated which provides the
 * required rosidl_message_type_support_t object.
 * This object can be obtained using a language appropriate mechanism.
 * \todo TODO(wjwwood) write these instructions once and link to it instead
 *
 * For C, a macro can be used (for example `std_msgs/String`):
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <rosidl_runtime_c/message_type_support_struct.h>
 * #include <std_msgs/msg/string.h>
 * const rosidl_message_type_support_t * string_ts =
 *   ROSIDL_GET_MSG_TYPE_SUPPORT(std_msgs, msg, String);
 * ```
 *
 * For C++, a template function is used:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include <rosidl_typesupport_cpp/message_type_support.hpp>
 * #include <std_msgs/msg/string.hpp>
 * const rosidl_message_type_support_t * string_ts =
 *   rosidl_typesupport_cpp::get_message_type_support_handle<std_msgs::msg::String>();
 * ```
 *
 * The rosidl_message_type_support_t object contains message type specific
 * information used to publish messages.
 *
 * The topic name must be a c string which follows the topic and service name
 * format rules for unexpanded names, also known as non-fully qualified names:
 *
 * \see rcl_expand_topic_name
 *
 * The options struct allows the user to set the quality of service settings as
 * well as a custom allocator which is used when initializing/finalizing the
 * publisher to allocate space for incidentals, e.g. the topic name string.
 *
 * Expected usage (for C messages):
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <rcl/rcl.h>
 * #include <rosidl_runtime_c/message_type_support_struct.h>
 * #include <std_msgs/msg/string.h>
 *
 * rcl_node_t node = rcl_get_zero_initialized_node();
 * rcl_node_options_t node_ops = rcl_node_get_default_options();
 * rcl_ret_t ret = rcl_node_init(&node, "node_name", "/my_namespace", &node_ops);
 * // ... error handling
 * const rosidl_message_type_support_t * ts = ROSIDL_GET_MSG_TYPE_SUPPORT(std_msgs, msg, String);
 * rcl_publisher_t publisher = rcl_get_zero_initialized_publisher();
 * rcl_publisher_options_t publisher_ops = rcl_publisher_get_default_options();
 * ret = rcl_publisher_init(&publisher, &node, ts, "chatter", &publisher_ops);
 * // ... error handling, and on shutdown do finalization:
 * ret = rcl_publisher_fini(&publisher, &node);
 * // ... error handling for rcl_publisher_fini()
 * ret = rcl_node_fini(&node);
 * // ... error handling for rcl_deinitialize_node()
