/** \mainpage rmw: ROS Middleware Abstraction Interface
 *
 * `rmw` defines an interface of middleware primitives that are used by the higher level ROS API's.
 * It consists of these main components:
 *
 * - Initialization and Shutdown:
 *   - rmw/init.h
 * - Nodes
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Publisher
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Subscription
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Service Client
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Service Server
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 *
 * There are some common utility functions in combination with "Topics" or "Services":
 * - A function to validate a fully qualified topic or service name
 *   - rmw_validate_full_topic_name()
 *   - rmw/validate_full_topic_name.h
 * - A function to validate a node's namespace
 *   - rmw_validate_namespace()
 *   - rmw/validate_namespace.h
 * - A function to validate a node's name
 *   - rmw_validate_node_name()
 *   - rmw/validate_node_name.h
 * - A function to validate the compatibility of two QoS profiles
 *   - rmw_qos_profile_check_compatible()
 *   - rmw/qos_profiles.h
 *
 * It also has some machinery that is necessary to wait on and act on these concepts:
 *
 * - Initialization and shutdown management (global for now)
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Wait sets for waiting on messages and service requests / responses to be ready
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Guard conditions for waking up wait sets asynchronously
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Introspection of the ROS graph
 *   - rmw_names_and_types_t
 *   - rmw_get_topic_names_and_types()
 *   - rmw_get_service_names_and_types()
 *   - rmw/names_and_types.h
 *   - rmw/get_topic_names_and_types.h
 *   - rmw/get_topic_endpoint_info.h
 *   - rmw/get_service_names_and_types.h
 *
 * Further still there are some useful abstractions and utilities:
 *
 * - Allocator functions for various types
 *   - rmw/allocators.h
 * - Error handling functionality (C style)
 *   - rmw/error_handling.h
 * - Macros
 *   - rmw/macros.h
 * - Return code types and other utility types
 *   - rmw/types.h
 * - Sanity checks for some of the types
 *   - rmw/sanity_checks.h
 * - Macros for controlling symbol visibility on the library
 *   - rmw/visibility_control.h
 * - Utility function to demangle a type to a human readable string (C++ specific):
 *   - rmw/impl/cpp/demangle.hpp

 *   - Access to the publisher allocation is not synchronized, unless specifically stated

 *     Thus, it is generally not safe to read or write `allocation` while rmw_publish() uses it.
 *     Check the implementation documentation to learn about publisher allocations' thread-safety.
