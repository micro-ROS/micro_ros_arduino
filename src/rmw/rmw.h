/** \mainpage rmw: ROS Middleware Abstraction Interface
 *
 * `rmw` defines an interface of middleware primitives that are used by the higher level ROS API's.
 * It consists of these main components:
 *
 * - Initialization and Shutdown:
 *   - rmw/init.h
 * - Nodes
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Publisher
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Subscription
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Service Client
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Service Server
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 *
 * There are some common utility functions in combination with "Topics" or "Services":
 * - A function to validate a fully qualified topic or service name
 *   - rmw_validate_full_topic_name()
 *   - rmw/validate_full_topic_name.h
 * - A function to validate a node's namespace
 *   - rmw_validate_namespace()
 *   - rmw/validate_namespace.h
 * - A function to validate a node's name
 *   - rmw_validate_node_name()
 *   - rmw/validate_node_name.h
 * - A function to validate the compatibility of two QoS profiles
 *   - rmw_qos_profile_check_compatible()
 *   - rmw/qos_profiles.h
 *
 * It also has some machinery that is necessary to wait on and act on these concepts:
 *
 * - Initialization and shutdown management (global for now)
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Wait sets for waiting on messages and service requests / responses to be ready
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Guard conditions for waking up wait sets asynchronously
 *   - rmw/rmw.h
 * - Introspection of the ROS graph
 *   - rmw_names_and_types_t
 *   - rmw_get_topic_names_and_types()
 *   - rmw_get_service_names_and_types()
 *   - rmw/names_and_types.h
 *   - rmw/get_topic_names_and_types.h
 *   - rmw/get_topic_endpoint_info.h
 *   - rmw/get_service_names_and_types.h
 *
 * Further still there are some useful abstractions and utilities:
 *
 * - Allocator functions for various types
 *   - rmw/allocators.h
 * - Error handling functionality (C style)
 *   - rmw/error_handling.h
 * - Macros
 *   - rmw/macros.h
 * - Return code types and other utility types
 *   - rmw/types.h
 * - Sanity checks for some of the types
 *   - rmw/sanity_checks.h
 * - Macros for controlling symbol visibility on the library
 *   - rmw/visibility_control.h
 * - Utility function to demangle a type to a human readable string (C++ specific):
 *   - rmw/impl/cpp/demangle.hpp

 *   - Access to the given subscription allocation is not synchronized,

 *
 * \par Memory allocation
 *   It is implementation defined whether memory will be allocated on take or not.
 *   For instance, implementations that deserialize ROS messages received over
 *   the wire may need to perform additional memory allocations when dealing with
 *   unbounded (dynamically-sized) fields.
 *   A subscription allocation, if provided, may or may not be used.
 *   Check the implementation documentation to learn about memory allocation
 *   guarantees when taking loaned ROS messages with and without subscription allocations.
 *
 * \par Thread-safety
 *   Subscriptions are thread-safe objects, and so are all operations on them except for
 *   finalization.
 *   Therefore, it is safe to take from the same subscription concurrently.
 *   However, when taking loaned ROS messages with metadata:
 *   - Access to given primitive data-type arguments is not synchronized.
 *     It is not safe to read or write `taken` nor `loaned_message`
 *     while rmw_take_loaned_message_with_info() uses them.
 *   - Access to the given ROS message metadata is not synchronized.
 *     It is not safe to read or write `message_info` while
 *     rmw_take_loaned_message_with_info() uses it.
 *   - Access to the given subscription allocation is not synchronized,
 *     unless specifically stated otherwise by the implementation.
 *     Thus, it is generally not safe to read or write `allocation` while
 *     rmw_take_loaned_message_with_info() uses it.
 *     Check the implementation documentation to learn about subscription allocations'
 *     thread-safety.
 *
 * \pre Given `subscription` must be a valid subscription, as returned
 *   by rmw_create_subscription().
 * \pre If not NULL, given `allocation` must be a valid subscription allocation initialized
 *   with rmw_subscription_allocation_init() with a message type support that matches the
 *   one registered with `subscription` on creation.
 * \post Given `loaned_message` will remain unchanged, or point to a valid message if
 *   this function was successful and `taken` is true.
 * \post Given `message_info` will remain valid message metadata.
 *   It will be left unchanged if this function fails early due to a logical error,
 *   such as an invalid argument, or in an unknown yet valid state if it fails due to a
 *   runtime error.
 *   It will also be left unchanged if this function succeeds but `taken` is false.
 *
